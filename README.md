Description of Web application
**The Intern Management System, made with PHP and MySQL, lets a company keep track of its interns' work. There are two users: the Admin and the Intern. Admins can control everything. They see all interns, can add new ones, assign them to work, change deadlines, and alter the status of tasks. They can even change or remove any of this info. Also, they can adjust the program or status lists. Interns can only see their own stuff. They can update their task status and personal info. Both types of users can sort and filter data. This tool can also help manage other stuff like projects or students.**
